            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi! My name is Joshua Rowan and I am a web development student currently enrolled in UTSA's edX fullstack
                bootcamp program. I am very grateful to be pursuing my passion for technology and transitioning into a
                career as a web developer. </p>
            <p>Before pursuing web development, I worked as an elementary and middle school teacher, where I honed my
                skills in communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. These skills have prove invaluable as I
                navigate the world of coding.</p>
            <p>In my freetime, I enjoy being with my children. Several of my current projects are directed towards
                helping parents with the unexpected responsibilities that may be thrust upon you as a father or mother.
                Like when your son's baseball team needs a coach, and you're the only willing one available, even though
                you NEVER got a hit in your life! <strong>Yes</strong>, I am speaking from personal experience - which
                is how the PocketCoach App became my first personal project.</p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I look forward to connecting with you and
                sharing my future projects with the world!</p>
