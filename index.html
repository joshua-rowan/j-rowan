                <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>Hi! My name is Joshua Rowan and I am a web development student currently enrolled in UTSA's edX fullstack bootcamp program. I am very grateful to be pursuing my passion for technology and transitioning into a career as a web developer. </p>
                    <p>Before pursuing web development, I worked as an elementary and middle school teacher, where I honed my skills in communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. These skills have prove invaluable as I navigate the world of coding.</p>
                    <p>In my freetime, I enjoy being with my children. Several of my current projects are directed towards helping parents with the unexpected responsibilities that may be thrust upon you as a father or mother. Like when your son's baseball team needs a coach, and you're the only willing one available, even though you NEVER got a hit in your life! <strong>Yes</strong>, I am speaking from personal experience - which is how the PocketCoach App became my first personal project.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I look forward to connecting with you and sharing my future projects with the world!</p>
